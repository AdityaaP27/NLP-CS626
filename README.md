 <h1 align="center"> NLP Techniques Implementation : CS 626 </h1>

This repository contains implementations of classical Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging and Named Entity Recognition (NER).

## Contents

### 1. POS Tagging using HMM
- **File**: `POS Tagging (HMM Based).ipynb`
- **Description**: Uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to perform POS tagging, leveraging probabilistic modeling.
- **Highlights**:
  - Probabilistic sequence modeling.
  - Emission and transition probabilities for tagging.

### 2. POS Tagging using CRF
- **File**: `POS Tagging (CRF Based).ipynb`
- **Description**: Applies Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for POS tagging. Focuses on hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
- **Highlights**:
  - Sequence labeling with CRF.
  - Hyperparameter optimization for improved tagging accuracy.

### 3. Named Entity Identification (NER) using SVM
- **File**: `NER SVM.ipynb`
- **Description**: Implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for Named Entity Identification (NEI). 
- **Highlights**:
  - Feature extraction for text data.
  - SVM-based classification.
  - Evaluation metrics to assess performance.
